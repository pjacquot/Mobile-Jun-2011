<p>Mobile Jun 2011 - <strong>Weeks 2-3 Assignment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Student:</strong> pjacquot - Patrice Jacquot</p>

<h1>Assignment: Basic Design Principles of a Mobile Web page</h1>

<h2>Assignment 2A</h2>

<p>During this assignment we will make the design of a web page about Beethoven's <em>Ode to Joy</em> mobile friendly.
On various mobile browsers, the page is zoomed out and required zoom in then double scrolling to be read.</p>

<a href="original/sample.html">Web page original version</a>

<h2>Step A: Remove double scrolling</h2>

<p>The following modifications are applied at this step:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add the <tt>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"/&gt;</tt> tag.</li>
  <li>Resize image <tt>beethoven.jpg</tt> to 120x150 and cropp + resize <tt>beethoven-background.jpg</tt> to 120x18.</li>
  <li>Changed the sidebar from left float to block, making the page linear with a liquid layout.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make the table more usable on a mobile device, I've applied these adaptations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The "Symphony" column header is renamed "Symphony nÂ°" and the word Symphony is removed from following rows.</li>
  <li>The the word "Op." is removed from the rows following the header "Op.".</li>
  <li>Padding of each cell is reduced</li>
  <li>Border tables collapse in CSS (<tt>border-collapse: collapse;</tt>) so we gain separation space between cells.</li>
</ul>

<a href="stepA/sample.html">Web page after step A</a>

<h2>Step B: Revamp menu</h2>

<p>Some elements of the menu are more useful than others. I picked the three items "Lyric Repository's Home",
"More information on this artist" and "Site Map" as the most useful links.
This arbitrary choice should ideally be validated and refined through user research (UX discipline).</p>
<p>The other menu items are moved to the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>I also made top menu item shorter and therefore more scannable by replacing "Lyric Repository's Home" by "Home"
and "More information on this artist" by "Beethoven".</p>

<p>I applied the appropriate style to make the menu items as one line buttons,
like I did for the <a href="../week1/">week 1 assignment</a>.</p>

<p>The link "lyrics of Fidelio" has been removed for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is supposed to be accessible through the category page pointed by "Other lyrics from this artist"</li>
  <li>The number of other lyrics can vary unpredictably, and may become potentially huge.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also applied a <tt>clear:both;</tt> to the <tt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> tag to ensure that
it has the available width as it is better to avoid additional line breaks because the lyrics are in verse.</p>
